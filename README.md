# fantrax-downloader

1. Install ruby
2. `FANTRAX_COOKIE="..." FANTRAX_LEAGUE_ID="..." ruby ./download.rb` which will create a player.csv in the same directory
3. Feel free to play with `analyze.rb` or use your own tool to analyze.
4. Hit me up if interested in any other data to be added to the CSV
5. You will need to grab your own cookie off fantrax as putting that in Github did not seem like a good idea
6. I'll probably do a goalkeeper stat download at some point, needs to be seperate due to different stats
